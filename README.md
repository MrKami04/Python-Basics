# Python-Basics
This is python basics to advance coding here.

W3School:
--> Python is a popular programming language.
--> It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
--> Python first program is : ```print("Hello World!.")```


--> creating variable as : ```num1 = 23 ; print(num1)``` or ```myName = str(Python); print(myName)```
--> check type of variable of data: use ```type()``` fuction , ```print(type(num1))``` .
--> variable name are case-sensitive: both are different:  a = 12 & A = 15 

-->There are many techniques to declare a variable name for more readability and clearity as :

--> 01-technique: camel-Case as each word starting letter capital except first letter.
```myName = "Python"; myVariableName = "John"; print(myName,"   ",  myVariableName) ```

--> 02-technique: Pascal-Case as each word start with capital letter.
``` MyVariableName = "John bro"; print(MyVariableName)```

--> 03-technique: snake-case as each word separate with underscore( _ ).
``` my_variable_name = "John-king"; print(my_variable_name) ```

--> multiple value assigne : ```x, y, z = 3, 4, 5; print(x, y, z), a1 = b1 = c1 = "Hello!"; print(a1, b1, c1)```
constant done.
